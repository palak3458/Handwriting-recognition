# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks

This project demonstrates a machine learning application for recognizing handwritten digits using a neural network. The model is trained on the popular [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which consists of grayscale images of digits (0-9) in 28x28 pixel format. The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying the handwritten digit in an image, even when tested with custom images.

## **Key Features**
1. **Neural Network Architecture**:
   - A simple yet powerful neural network designed with a single hidden layer consisting of **128 neurons**.
   - Uses the **ReLU activation function** to learn complex patterns.
   - A softmax output layer for multi-class classification of digits (0-9).

2. **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and custom handwritten digit prediction.
   - Allows users to test the model with their own handwritten digit images.

3. **Custom Testing**:
   - Users can draw their own digits (e.g., using a drawing tool) or upload handwritten digit images to test the model's predictions.

4. **Highly Efficient Training**:
   - The model uses the **Adam optimizer**, which adapts learning rates for faster convergence.
   - Trains for **3 epochs**, ensuring a balance between speed and accuracy.

5. **Accurate Results**:
   - Achieves high accuracy on both the MNIST test set and custom handwritten digit images.

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
The MNIST dataset is preprocessed to ensure the model learns effectively:
- Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] for faster and more stable training.
- Images are flattened from 28x28 pixels into a 1D vector with 784 features.

### **2. Model Architecture**
The neural network is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts 28x28 pixel images flattened into a 1D vector of size 784.
- **Hidden Layer**: 
  - Contains **128 neurons**.
  - Uses **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** activation to capture non-linear patterns.
- **Output Layer**: 
  - Contains **10 neurons** (one for each digit class).
  - Uses **softmax activation** to output probabilities for each digit class.

### **3. Model Compilation**
The model is compiled with the following configurations:
- **Optimizer**: Adam, for efficient and adaptive optimization.
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy, to calculate the error for multi-class classification.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, to monitor the percentage of correct predictions during training and testing.

### **4. Model Training**
The model is trained on the MNIST training dataset:
- **Epochs**: 3, to allow the model to re-examine the entire dataset multiple times and refine its weights.
- **Batch Size**: 32, for efficient training in small chunks of data.

### **5. Model Evaluation**
After training, the model is evaluated on the MNIST test dataset to measure its accuracy and generalization. The test accuracy is displayed upon completion.

### **6. Custom Testing**
Users can test the model with their own handwritten digits:
- Images are processed to match the MNIST format (28x28 pixels, grayscale, normalized).
- The model predicts the digit in the image and outputs the result.

## **How to Run the Project**

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow (for image preprocessing)

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow
```

### **2. Train the Model**
Run the script to train the model on the MNIST dataset:
```bash
python mnist_model.py
```
The script will:
- Load the MNIST dataset.
- Train the model for 3 epochs.
- Save the trained model as `my_mnist_model.h5`.

### **3. Test the Model on Custom Images**
To test the model with your own handwritten digit images:
1. Draw a digit using a tool like Preview on Mac or any other drawing tool.
2. Save the image as `digit.png` (or any other name).
3. Run the testing script:
   ```bash
   python test_handwritten_digit.py
   ```
4. The script will preprocess your image, make a prediction, and display the result.

## **Project Files**
- `mnist_model.py`: Script to train the neural network on the MNIST dataset and save the model.
- `test_handwritten_digit.py`: Script to preprocess custom images, load the trained model, and make predictions.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## **Results**
- The model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset (~97%).
- For custom handwritten digits, the model performs well as long as the images are properly preprocessed (28x28 pixels, grayscale).

## **Future Improvements**
- Extend the model to recognize digits in images with noise or poor handwriting.
- Experiment with deeper architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks) for better performance.
- Add a web-based or GUI interface for easier testing and interaction.
